# Microcontroller Interface Documentation

This project aims at providing a simple user interface for controlling various microcontrollers. By utlizing the provided gui and defining the desired functions from the base file (required to map CMDs to hardware),  The ultimate goal is to aid in rapid hardware prototyping by eliminating the burden of intial software bring up and device programming. [Click here](https://moleson21.github.io/uc-interface) to see the complete documentation.

This is a documentation site for uc Interface. See below for class and method definitions as well as additional documentation on creating the microcontroller programs and developing the GUI.
